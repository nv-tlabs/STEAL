## Usage

##### Clone this repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nv-tlabs/STEAL
cd STEAL
 ```

#### Install dependencies

This code requires PyTorch 0.4 and python 3+. Please install dependencies by
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Download pretrained models

Download the tar of the pretrained models from the [Google Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/open?id=15IrPfMe9ZXJ4g0UV7tcA-LWPzCIPc1Sr), save it in 'checkpoints/', and run

```bash
cd checkpoints
tar -xvf checkpoints.tar.gz
cd ../
```


#### Inference (SBD)
```
python inference_sbd.py \
    --root_dir_val= ./data/sbd/data_aug/\
    --flist_val= ./data/sbd/data_aug/val_list.txt\
    --output_folder=./output/sbd/ \
    --ckpt=./checkpoints/sbd/model_checkpoint.pt\
```

Instructions and preprocessing scripts to download SBD and preprocess the dataset can be found here:
https://github.com/Chrisding/sbd-preprocess



#### Inference (Cityscapes)
```
python inference_cityscapes.py \
    --root_dir_val=./data/cityscapes-preprocess/data_proc \
    --flist_val=./data_proc/val.txt \
    --output_folder=./output/cityscapes/ \
    --ckpt=./checkpoints/cityscapes/model_checkpoint.pt\
```

Instructions and preprocessing scripts for Cityscapes can be found here:
https://github.com/Chrisding/cityscapes-preprocess



*Test-NMS:*
An  example of how to apply TEST-NMS using [Piotr's Structured Forest matlab toolbox](https://github.com/pdollar/edges). can be found in `utils/edges_nms.m`.
During training, we optimized for the same set of operations with r=2 (Check paper for more details)


#### Coarse-to-fine Demo
Checkout the ipython notebook that provides a simple walkthrough demonstrating how to run our model to refine coarsely annotated data.
